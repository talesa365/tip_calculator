Python tip calculator


This is a tip calculator app that takes a user's input at the command line for

-Cost of the food
-Number of people splitting the bill
-Percentage of the tip
-After a tip has been calculated, your program should ask the user if they would like to enter another tip, and run again if the answer is yes.




output:

-The total bill (including tip)
-How much each person should pay (you can assume all people will split the bill evenly)
 

Assume there is a 10% sales tax. Don't forget to add this into the total bill! 

Note: your tip calculator should be able to handle a bill of any amount of many money, with any number of people splitting the bill, and with any tip percentage (including 0 tip)
